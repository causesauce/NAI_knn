Programming task 1

K-nearest-neighbours (k-NN)

Implement k-nearest-neighbours algorithm.

Input arguments provided by user:

- path to file with training data

- path to file with test data

- k - number of neighbors positive integer

As a result program should classify all samples from test data with kNN algorithm based on training data and compute accuracy (number of correctly classified samples over number of all

samples).

Program should be tested on data from iris folder. File ’train.txt’ contains

training data. File ’test.txt’ contains test data. Program reads the data from

training set and classify each case from the test set.

Provide user interface (does not have to be graphical) to manually input attribute vector for classification and get the label based on training data.

Program should be universal, that is it works on any data which attributes are numerical except of decision attribute.

Program should be self -written and presented during tutorials. External libraries cannot be used.

Optional: Plot accuracy versus K (using excel, python etc).
